# Assignments

The assignment operator is <-.
Assignments should be made in the following format:
```
<identifier> <- <value>
```
The identifier must refer to a variable (this can be an individual element in a data structure such as an array or a user defined data type). The value may be any expression that evaluates to a value of the same data type as the variable.
